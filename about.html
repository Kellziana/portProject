                    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
                    <p>I’m Ricardo Moncada, a digital animator and digital artist, currently finishing my education in digital animation and interactive design. I work independently, taking commissions for digital art and visualizers. I've contributed to two 3D animated short films as part of my school projects, using tools such as Maya, Blender, and Adobe Creative Suite. Born and raised in Honduras, where I currently reside, I specialize in 2D designs and animations. I plan to continue creating short animations with the goal of showcasing them at festivals. Additionally, I’m eager to collaborate with record labels that need artistic or animated content to enhance their projects.</p>

                <h2>Animations</h2>
                <p>In my animations I explore both 2D and 3D techniques, with visualizers that contain trippy aesthetics. My animations are influenced by my love for early 2000's cartoon shows and videogames, as well as streetwear and hip-hop culture.</p>
